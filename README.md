# Learning [GSAP](https://github.com/greensock/GSAP) (GreenSock Animation Platform)

Basically the best from both CSS and jQuery: fast like CSS animations, but higher control and browser compatibility like jQuery animations.

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

## Setup

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.7.1/gsap.min.js"></script>
```

or: [npm install gsap](https://greensock.com/docs/Installation)

## Further references

- Most popular features, with codepen demos: <https://greensock.com/get-started>
- Draggable: <https://greensock.com/draggable>
- Forked ScrollTrigger demo: <https://codepen.io/hchiam/pen/xxdQgVP> shows how easy it is to do scroll-based animation

## Why

Certain properties for CSS animations are hardware-accelerated, and simpler animations can be done with CSS, but for better perf than jQuery animations and more complex animation control than can be easily-manageably done with with CSS, use GSAP.
